								<h1>Life in Plastic</h1> 
								<h2>Is recycling the only solution?</h2>
							</header>
									<p>It is impossible to recycle everything and it is even more impossible to reach every trash that has been thrown away ending up in the ocean. Recycling is not the solution, just a small part of the solution. We need to be more aware of the harsh realities related to every purchase we do. We need to start refusing products and reusing products so that we will be able to reduce our negative impact on the environment.  We all need to be responsible, even if it's not your trash, even if you say "oh but I throw my garbage in the bin, it's other people's fault, not mine". This is our home and we need to start acting now!</p><br>
									<p>Read this <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/plastics-facts-infographics-ocean-pollution" target="_blank">article</a> for fast facts about plastic pollution.</p><br><br>

							  	<h3>Do you think that trash just disappears?</h3>
									<p>People are so funny. As long as they don't have trash in their house, that is all that matters. They fail to understand that it's time to stop buying immoderately and treating our trash irresposibly. Let's take a look on this <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/graphics/the-journey-of-plastic-around-the-globe" target="_blank">article</a> and see what happens to the trash we throw out.</p>
